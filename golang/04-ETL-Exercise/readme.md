# ETL GO(lang) Unit Test Examples

## Exercise

1. Refactor the code; move any transformation logic into its own function so that it can be unit tested.

hint: Write and group tests around business logic; not around coding logic.  For example one test function could cover `hasCheese`, another `hasFruit`, another `hasFruit`, and so on.
